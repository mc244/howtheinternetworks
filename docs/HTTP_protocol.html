                    <p>The Internet uses a language called HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol in order to communicate between web browsers and servers. It’s almost like a manual that tells the computer what information you are looking for and how you want to receive that information. As the user, when we type in the URL or Uniform Resource Locator, it causes the computer to make GET requests. In other words, a request to retrieve data from that website. Once the website’s IP address has received the request, it will send a response back with the proper HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language to display the information that is what requested.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sometimes, as users we can also send out data in the form of POST requests. Data is sent as plain text over the internet, which makes it vulnerable to hackers. Since the Internet is open and public to everyone, it is imperative that we are able to be ensured that we can make secure connections from computer to computer so that our personal information isn't stolen. Safe websites prevent snooping and tampering by communicating through a secure channel using two layers called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). These layers help the language known as HTTPS or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. By using HTTPS, it ensures your HTTP request are secure and protected. When a website asks your browser to communicate with its server, a safe website will provide a digital certificate that has been verified by authorities. This is also indicated by a small lock sign next to the https in the browser bar. Without a legitimate digital certificate, your computer will notify you that the website you are trying to access is not secure.</p>
