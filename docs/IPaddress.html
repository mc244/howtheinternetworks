                    <br>
                    <p>If the domain name was to a website as an address is to a house, then the IP address is rest of the necessary information on an envelope or package to ensure that the right person receives the right package. On an envelope, the sender's name, the return address, the receiver's name, and the receiver's address needed are almost exactly the same information you need in an IP address. "IP" means Internet Protocol. In other words, in order to have your computer communicate with other computers, there needs to be a basic mutual agreement between the computers in order to understand the data that you are asking for. That is why we have protocols, a set of guidelines on how the data will be addressed, delivered, or routed to your computer. There are many layers to the IP address that makes it a unique number for all computers, and an essential part of being able to request and receive data from other computers. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition, data is sent in packets of information, and each packet of data may not all travel on the same network to arrive at your computer, depending on traffic in the network. This is made possible because the Internet is made of distributed networks. Yet, it is possible for all the requested data to arrive at the same place because it is "tagged" with your unique IP address. The speed at which the packets arrive at its destination can be helped along by routers. They act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving smoothly through the network.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Each router keeps track of the best route for data to travel to it's destination. Since there are multiple routes to choose from, it makes the internet fault tolerant, meaning it is possible to continue sending the same packet even if something happens the first time it is sent out. This makes the internet reliable.</p>
